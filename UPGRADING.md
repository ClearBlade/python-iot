# 2.0.0 Migration Guide

The 2.0 release of the `clearblade-cloud-iot` client is a significant upgrade based on addition of two new classes in **iot_v1**:
**DeviceCredential**
**PublicKeyCredential**

The release also includes enhancements to these classes already present in **iot_v1**:
**DeviceConfig**
**DeviceState**

The version was made with the intent of minimizing required code changes. But some changes are Breaking.

1. If **device** is an object of class **Device**...
   **Before**:
   device.credentials is of type **[dict]** (i.e. list of dicts).

   **After**:
   device.credentials is of type **[DeviceCredential]** (i.e. list of objects of class DeviceCredential).

   The **DeviceCredential** class has these features for usability:

   - A **get** method that mimics the **get** method of a dict.
   - Allows accessing attributes using dot notation OR square-brackets.
   - Supports camel-case as well as snake-case for accessing attributes:

   e.g. All these are valid for retrieving the public key:

   - **public_key = device.credentials[0]['publicKey']**
   - **public_key = device.credentials[0]['public_key']**
   - **public_key = device.credentials[0].get('publicKey')**
   - **public_key = device.credentials[0].get('public_key')**
   - **public_key = device.credentials[0].publicKey**
   - **public_key = device.credentials[0].public_key**

2. This refers to pub_key mentioned in the previous section.
   **Before**:
   public_key was of type **dict**.

   **After**:
   public_key is an object of class **PublicKeyCredential**.

   The **PublicKeyCredential** class has these features for usability:

   - A **get** method that mimics the **get** method of a dict.
   - Allows accessing attributes using dot notation OR square-brackets.

   e.g. All these are valid for retrieving the public key format:

   - **format = public_key['format']**
   - **format = public_key.get('format')**
   - **format = public_key.format**

3. This section refers to **dev_config** which holds device config...
   **Before**:
   dev_config is of type **dict**.

   **After**:
   dev_config is an object of class **DeviceConfig**.

   The **DeviceConfig** class has these features for usability:

   - A **get** method that mimics the **get** method of a dict.
   - Allows accessing attributes using dot notation OR square-brackets.
   - Supports camel-case as well as snake-case for accessing attributes:

   e.g. All these are valid for retrieving the cloud_update_time:

   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0]['cloudUpdateTime']**
   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0]['cloud_update_time']**
   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0].get('cloudUpdateTime')**
   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0].get('cloud_update_time')**
   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0].cloudUpdateTime**
   - **cloud_update_time = device.credentials[0].cloud_update_time**

4. This section refers to **dev_state** which contains device state...
   **Before**:
   dev_state is of type **dict**.

   **After**:
   dev_state is an object of class **DeviceState**.

   The **DeviceState** class has these features for usability:

   - A **get** method that mimics the **get** method of a dict.
   - Allows accessing attributes using dot notation OR square-brackets.
   - Supports camel-case as well as snake-case for accessing attributes:

   e.g. All these are valid for retrieving the binary_data:

   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0]['binaryData']**
   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0]['binary_data']**
   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0].get('binaryData')**
   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0].get('binary_data')**
   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0].binaryData**
   - **binary_data = device.credentials[0].binary_data**
